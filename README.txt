The wireframes and Requirement Specifications document are contained within the 'Documentation' folder. 'Initial_01' to 'Initial_05' are the wireframes from initial phase of the design, while 'Revision_04a' and 'Revision_04b' are wireframes from a latter revision.

The 'contact', 'portfolio', and 'work' folders contain the index files for their relevant pages, as well as any page specific material not used elsewhere on the site.
